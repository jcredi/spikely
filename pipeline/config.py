# MGRS tiles intersecting a 60 km corridor around the Alpine arc and the
# Italian Apennine spine. The set was resolved once against Copernicus's own
# MGRS_tiles.gpkg so production discovery does not depend on a 16 MB reference
# file or on a spatial-library stack.
#
# The geometric corridor also selected four squares that HR-WSI does not
# publish at all - 33SVD, 33SXB, 33TTF and 33TUE - and they are deliberately
# excluded here. They are not a transient catalogue gap: on 2026-08-27 a direct
# listing found zero objects under GFSC/<tile>/ for every year 2016-2026, and
# likewise under FSC/, SWS/ and WDS/, while HR-WSI's own GFSC grid enumerated
# 983 tiles containing none of them. They are valid Sentinel-2 tiles - all four
# are in Copernicus's MGRS_tiles.gpkg - but they are open-sea squares
# (Tyrrhenian and Ionian), off the coast rather than on the Apennine spine, so
# HR-WSI does not produce them and no snow-relevant land is lost by dropping
# them. The same is true of every other square missing from HR-WSI's grid
# nearby (33TXG, 33TYG, 33SUA, 33SXA - all sea). Because of this, a tile
# reported missing by a run is now a real anomaly worth failing on rather than
# expected noise.

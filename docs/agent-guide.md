# Nevaio - agent guide

Shared instructions for any coding agent working in this repo (Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex, or otherwise). Tool-specific entry points - `.claude/CLAUDE.md`,
`AGENTS.md` - are one-line adapters that point here; keep the actual content
in this file only, so the two never drift apart.

## What this is
A free, mobile-friendly web app showing quasi-real-time Copernicus snow-cover data (GFSC) over an outdoor/topo map of the Alps + Italian Apennines, for hikers and mountaineers. Full requirements: @docs/spec.md. Current plan and status: @docs/plan.md.

## Security
Controls, deliberate decisions that look like oversights, and how to re-check
them: @docs/security.md. Read it before touching `app/public/_headers`,
`app/src/features/snow/manifestSchema.ts`, the publishing workflow, or the `maplibre-gl`
version.

## Project areas
- **`app/`** - frontend map (MapLibre GL JS + OSM-based topo basemap).
- **`pipeline/`** - production GFSC processing, a src-layout package at `pipeline/src/nevaio_pipeline/` with its tests in `pipeline/tests/` and dev tools in `pipeline/tools/`. Its pure AS-OF semantic core is independent of raster I/O so the frozen rules stay directly testable.
- **`data/`** - local only, nothing committed but its README. `research/` is the durable winter GFSC archive (~1.5 GB) that real-data checks depend on; `cache/` and `output/` are disposable. See `data/README.md`.
- **`docs/research/`** - what the GFSC data actually is (`gfsc-findings.md`), as opposed to what we decided about it.

`recon/` was dissolved on 2026-09-09 - it bundled four things with four lifecycles, so its long-promised deletion could never fire. Its parts are now the `data/` tree, `docs/research/`, `pipeline/tools/`, and `pipeline/.venv`.

## Ground rules
- Early planning/prototyping stage. Favor small, visible, working steps over broad refactors, heavy abstraction, or building for hypothetical scale.
- No user accounts, no backend database for the MVP - see docs/spec.md section 11.
- Snow data source is GFSC (60 m, gap-filled, single value per pixel) - not raw FSCOG/FSCTOC. Don't reintroduce an on-ground/top-of-canopy toggle; see docs/spec.md section 7.2 for why.
- Copernicus data requires attribution; so does OpenStreetMap (ODbL). Don't drop attribution from any map view.
- docs/spec.md is the frozen product spec. Don't treat something as an open question if it's already answered there - check first.

## `app/` conventions
- Vite + TypeScript, no UI framework yet (deferred until panels/charts are actually built - see docs/spec.md section 15 item 8). Package manager: npm.
- Basemap: MapTiler "Outdoor" vector style via MapLibre GL JS. Requires `VITE_MAPTILER_API_KEY` in `app/.env` (see `app/.env.example`); get a free key at maptiler.com. OpenTopoMap (raster, no key) is the documented fallback if that becomes a blocker.
- Layout: **grouped by feature, not by technical layer** (REFACTOR stage 3, 2026-09-12). `src/main.ts` wires everything together; `src/map/` holds only map infrastructure that no single feature owns (`config.ts` - style URL, initial view, overlay URL, search bias; `scale.ts`); and each feature owns its network validator, its map layer and its UI control together in `src/features/<feature>/`:
  - `features/snow/` - `overlay.ts` (GFSC image source + raster layer), `manifestSchema.ts`, `dateCatalogue.ts`/`dateCatalogueSchema.ts`, `control.ts` (layer toggle), `dateControl.ts` (AS-OF picker).
  - `features/search/` - `geocode.ts`/`geocodeResult.ts`, `coordinates.ts`, `searchBar.ts`.
  - `features/objects/` - `objectIndex.ts`, `objectIndexSchema.ts`, `selection.ts`, `panel.ts`, `highlight.ts`.
  - `features/route/` - `directionsSchema.ts`/`directions.ts` (Mapbox Directions), `routeProfile.ts` (pure geometry), `routeLayer.ts`, `routePanel.ts`, `routePrompt.ts`, `routeController.ts` (the state machine).
  A new feature gets a folder; don't reintroduce a `ui/` or `objects/` layer folder beside them. `src/style.css` stays one file (full-bleed responsive layout, mobile safe-area insets) - the responsive rules cross features and splitting them was what broke the mobile layout before.
- **There is no offline/sample snow data.** When the published snapshot is missing or fails validation, `addSnowOverlay` returns `null` and the control renders "Snow data unavailable" - no layer, no toggle, no legend. Don't reintroduce a checked-in sample raster: a months-old image read as today's conditions is a real hazard for the decisions this app supports (spec section 5.4). Removed 2026-09-09 along with the archive and tooling behind it.
- MapLibre's own CSS styles `.maplibregl-ctrl-group button` at 29x29px; custom controls in a ctrl-group need a more specific selector to override it.
- **Two bottom sheets, one height contract.** The object panel (spec section 7) and the route panel (section 8) both sit at the bottom, and the bottom-left snow control must clear whichever is open. `app/src/map/bottomSheet.ts` is the single coupling point: each open sheet registers its laid-out height, the module publishes the tallest as `--bottom-sheet-height`, and `style.css` offsets the control by it. Heights are *observed* with a `ResizeObserver`, never measured once on open - a sheet keeps growing after it is revealed (the history chart arrives asynchronously), and measuring the moment instead of the element is exactly how a real overlap shipped before. Only one sheet is open at a time by policy (`routeController.ts` closes the object panel when a route lands); the max-of-all-sheets rule is what keeps this correct if that policy changes.
- **Anything anchored to the top of the screen has to clear the search bar *and* the AS-OF date pill.** Measured at 320 and 390 CSS px: the search bar ends at 52px and the date pill, in its tallest (slider) form, ends at 113px. That stack has caused three collisions now, most recently the route planner's half-planned strip. `npm run check-mobile-layout` asserts every one of them - extend it rather than eyeballing a new offset.
- **Routing is gated on `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` and is invisible without it** - no route panel, no prompt, no endpoint buttons in the object panel. That is deliberate: an absent control is honest, a control that fails when pressed is not. The token must be a **new, URL-restricted Mapbox public token**, never the account default (Mapbox does not apply URL restrictions to default tokens), and like `VITE_MAPTILER_API_KEY` it is deliberately not marked secret in Netlify. `api.mapbox.com` is in `connect-src` in `app/public/_headers`, and `connect-src` only: no Mapbox script, style, font or tile is loaded, and it must stay that way.
- **The route panel deliberately shows no walking time and no elevation gain/loss.** Mapbox returns a `duration`; it is an urban-walking estimate with no elevation input, and on alpine terrain a confident number is wrong in the direction that strands people after dark. Elevation is not returned at all. Both are stated as unavailable rather than omitted silently. Don't "complete" the panel by surfacing the duration - `routePanel.ts`'s docstring is the reasoning.
- `npm run check-mobile-layout` (needs `npm run dev`) is the emulator baseline at 320 and 390 CSS px: it fails if the search bar slides under the navigation controls or the object panel covers the snow control. Not a substitute for a real handset.
- Dev server: `npm run dev` (from `app/`), bound to loopback on purpose - use `npm run dev -- --host` for a deliberate LAN opt-in (phone testing), not the config. Build: `npm run build` (outputs static `dist/`, deployable as-is). Visual check: `npm run shot` (Playwright, needs the dev server running).
- **`maplibre-gl` stays on 4.7.1 deliberately.** `npm audit` reports a critical advisory against it (GHSA-jrc7-96c5-q579, sanitizer bypass in `DOM.sanitize()`, affecting **all** versions <= 6.4.0, so 4.x and 5.x alike). Do not "fix" it by upgrading: 6.x fetches the MapTiler TileJSON and then requests zero vector tiles, giving a blank basemap with no console error - measured, not guessed (4.7.1: 54 tiles / 2279 rendered features; 6.0.0, 6.4.1 and 6.9.0: 0 / 0). The advisory's sink is HTML MapLibre renders itself - popups, HTML markers, attribution - and this app has no popups, no HTML markers, and a literal attribution string, so there is no attacker-reachable path without MapTiler itself being compromised, and the deployed CSP blocks the script execution an injection would need. Revisit when a 6.x release renders this style, or if the app ever adds popups or renders remote HTML - that changes the analysis.
- Place search uses MapTiler Geocoding (`app/src/features/search/geocode.ts`), not Nominatim - the OSMF endpoint prohibits client-side autocomplete (spec amendment v1.9). Response parsing/classification lives in `geocodeResult.ts` with no config or `import.meta.env` imports, so `npm test` can run it directly under Node; keep it that way. MapTiler's default result ranking buries peaks and huts under same-named streets, hence the explicit POI/place `types` list.
- Snow metadata arriving over the network (`latest.json`) is validated by `app/src/features/snow/manifestSchema.ts` before any value reaches MapLibre; tile URLs must stay on the manifest's own origin and run directory. If the pipeline ever adds a field the frontend needs, or moves where tiles live, that validator changes with it. `npm test` runs its cases (Node executes the TypeScript directly, no bundler).
- Object selection (spec section 7) reads Nevaio's own static OSM object index, never MapTiler's rendered feature properties. `docs/research/maptiler-outdoor-objects.md` is the measured reason and is worth reading before touching any of it: the Outdoor style renders no saddles at all, only `rank == 1` peaks (about a quarter of them, and `rank` changes with zoom), and symbol collision culls most of the rest. `app/src/features/objects/objectIndexSchema.ts` validates the sharded index the way `manifestSchema.ts` validates `latest.json` - shard paths must stay on the index URL's own origin and directory - and `selection.ts` holds the tap-to-record rule and its failure modes. Shards load lazily by viewport from the R2 publication - 54 shards, 211,881 objects, 28.6 MB, published 2026-09-12 by `publish-osm-object-index.yml`. The old `app/public/object-index/` fixture is gone; `VITE_OBJECT_INDEX_URL` overrides the default if you need a local or rebuilt index. Six object kinds are in the artifact (`peak`, `hut`, `saddle`, `shelter`, `parking`, `settlement`) - the `ObjectKind` literal in `pipeline/src/nevaio_pipeline/object_index.py` is the list, and the frontend validator must accept exactly it.
- The historical AS-OF date picker (spec section 5.3) reads `dates.json`, published beside `latest.json`; its URL is *derived* from `VITE_SNOW_MANIFEST_URL` by `dateCatalogueUrlFor`, so that one variable stays the single trust anchor for the snow layer - don't add a second one. `app/src/features/snow/dateCatalogueSchema.ts` validates it as a public contract and mirrors `validate_date_catalogue` in the pipeline; when one side's rules change, both move. An archived date manifest is `latest.json`-shaped and lives in the same directory, so `validateTileManifest` accepts it unchanged - keep it that way. Fewer than two available dates renders a plain label rather than a one-option select. A local preview wants `app/public/snow/dates.json` and `asof-<date>-<runId>.json` beside `latest.json`; all three are gitignored.
- The four network-facing validators (`features/snow/manifestSchema.ts`, `features/snow/dateCatalogueSchema.ts`, `features/objects/objectIndexSchema.ts`, `features/route/directionsSchema.ts`) each keep their own copies of the URL-trust and primitive-check helpers. That duplication is deliberate: each one reads and audits end to end on its own. Don't consolidate them into a shared module.
- `app/public/_headers` carries the deployed CSP and other browser policy headers, as an explicit allowlist of the origins the app talks to. Adding an outbound destination (new geocoder, new tile host, the F10 R2 custom domain) means editing it in the same change. `npm run check-csp` replays those headers over the real build and fails on any violation; `NEVAIO_URL=https://nevaio.netlify.app npm run check-csp` checks the live deployment, which is the only mode that can exercise the R2 legs (bucket CORS allows production only).
- Deploy: Netlify, connected to this GitHub repo via its dashboard (no committed `netlify.toml`) - base directory `app`, build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`. Every push to `main` auto-deploys to https://nevaio.netlify.app; no manual step.
- `VITE_MAPTILER_API_KEY` is also set as a Netlify env var (all deploy contexts), deliberately **not** marked "secret": Vite inlines `VITE_*` vars into the client bundle by design, so Netlify's secret-scanning would fail the build on a value that's supposed to reach the browser. The real access control for that key is MapTiler's own domain restriction, not Netlify's secret masking.

## Research and sample data
- Findings go in `docs/research/gfsc-findings.md` as you go - short bullet notes, not a formal write-up. That file is a dated record of the Aug 2026 reconnaissance; the 1.5 GB archive it describes was deleted on 2026-09-09 once nothing depended on it. HR-WSI keeps its own history back to 2016, so re-download if a question needs real winter rasters again.
- Never commit downloaded raster samples (see .gitignore) - they're large and not ours to redistribute outside the app itself.

## `pipeline/` conventions
- Python. Keep the semantic core independent of raster I/O, reprojection, storage, and scheduling; those are adapters around it.
- AS-OF behavior must match `docs/spec.md` sections 5.2-5.4 and 9.2. Add focused tests for every semantic edge case rather than re-encoding rules in callers.
- **Where Nevaio shows snow is defined once**, in `footprint.py`, derived from `config.MVP_MGRS_TILES`. Anything that needs a geographic answer - is this point inside, what are a tile's bounds, which UTM zone is a tile in - asks that module. Don't add a second outline of the same area, in Python or in the frontend, and don't reach for a spatial library to do it: the MGRS set was resolved by hand precisely so production carries no such stack, and the module is pure standard library for that reason.
- Entry points are `python -m nevaio_pipeline.render` (was `pipeline.preview`), `python -m nevaio_pipeline.publish`, `python -m nevaio_pipeline.publish_object_index` and `python -m nevaio_pipeline.publish_object_series`. `pipeline/src/nevaio_pipeline/__init__.py` exports lazily on purpose - the publisher must import without the native raster stack, so never add an eager `from .tiles import ...` there.
- CI does not pip-install the package; it sets `PYTHONPATH=pipeline/src`. That is deliberate - a build backend inside the publish job would enlarge a dependency surface that exists to be exactly one package. Don't "tidy" it into a pip install.
- Local environment is `pipeline/.venv` on **Python 3.12**, matching CI. Create it with `uv venv --python 3.12 pipeline/.venv && uv pip install --python pipeline/.venv -r pipeline/requirements-dev.in`. Tests: `PYTHONPATH=pipeline/src pipeline/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s pipeline/tests -t pipeline`. Both parts are load-bearing and match what CI runs: without `PYTHONPATH` nothing imports `nevaio_pipeline`, and without `-t pipeline` the two tests that share `tests/artifact_fixture.py` fail to import. A bare `discover -s pipeline/tests` errors on 15 of them.
- **Two publishing workflows reach the same R2 bucket and the same `production-r2` environment**, deliberately split by lifecycle: `publish-latest-preview.yml` (daily GFSC snapshot, scheduled) and `publish-osm-object-index.yml` (`workflow_dispatch` only, because the OSM object index changes when the extracts refresh, not daily). They do not collide in the bucket: the snapshot owns the root keys (`runs/`, `latest.json`, `dates.json`, `asof-*.json`) and the index owns `object-index/`. Two routes to one publication key means both are held to the same trust boundary, and `pipeline/tests/test_workflow_security.py` asserts it over both - secrets confined to a single step that does no `pip install`, SHA-pinned actions, `persist-credentials: false`, the untrusted artifact revalidated before any secret is in scope. Add a third workflow and it gets a class in that file too.
- `publish-osm-object-index.yml` takes the OSM extract URLs as a `workflow_dispatch` input rather than hardcoding a region list, because which extracts cover the footprint was never decided. That input is attacker-controlled in the same sense any dispatch input is, so it must stay an `env:` var quoted in the shell - never interpolated as a bare `${{ inputs.* }}` inside `run:`. There is a test for exactly that.
- **The per-tile slot map is permanent, append-only, durable state, and the only thing keeping published `.bin` byte offsets valid.** It lives at `object-index/slots/<TILE>.json` in R2, and the daily workflow *fetches it, extends it, and publishes it back* - it is never rebuilt from scratch on a runner. Two consequences that are easy to undo by accident, both pinned by tests or comments:
  - `publish_object_index`'s stale-key cleanup is scoped to `object-index/objects/` and must stay that way. Diffing the whole `object-index/` prefix would see every slot map as an orphan and delete it on the next OSM refresh.
  - In the daily workflow, **only a literal 404 means "no slot map yet"**. `load_or_create_slot_map` builds a fresh map when the file is absent, so treating a timeout or 5xx as absence would rebuild an existing tile's ordering, shift every slot after a departed object's hole, and silently invalidate that tile's whole published history. Any non-404 failure skips the tile for that run instead - one lost day beats a corrupted history.
  Neither failure shows up as an error; both show up as wrong numbers on a chart, which is why they are written down here.
- Three dependency surfaces, deliberately: `requirements.in`/`.txt` (render, hash-locked) and `requirements-publish.in`/`.txt` (publish, hash-locked) are CI's contract and are compiled for **linux x86_64**, so they cannot be installed on a Mac. `requirements-dev.in` is the local mirror and the only one carrying dev-tool-only dependencies. Don't add a tool's dependency to the render or publish locks to make a local script run.

## Workflow
- Use plan mode (or the equivalent approval/preview step in whichever tool you are) for anything touching more than one file, or where the approach isn't obvious. Skip it for small, clearly-scoped fixes.
- Favor steps with a visible or checkable result: for `app/`, "does it render correctly in a browser"; for `pipeline/`, "does the script run and produce inspectable output."

## Recordkeeping - update before ending a session
Two files survive past this conversation, and they are split **by tense**.
Update both whenever code changed or a real decision got made; skip both for
pure exploration that changed nothing.
- **`docs/worklog.md` - the past.** Narrative session log, newest entry first:
  what was done, what was decided *and why*, what was explicitly rejected and
  why, what is still open. The "rejected" section matters most - it is what
  stops a later session re-litigating a dead end. Append; never rewrite old
  entries.
- **`docs/plan.md` - the future.** Status, what is next in order, what is open,
  what we are not doing yet. **When something ships it leaves this file** - the
  worklog entry is the record. Never add a "done" section here.

Neither is `docs/spec.md` (frozen intent), `docs/research/gfsc-findings.md` (what the data
is), or `docs/security.md` (what protects the project).

Retired on 2026-09-09, deliberately - do not reinstate without asking:
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** (now `docs/archive/CHANGELOG.md`). It was a third
  narration of what the worklog already held, and there are no releases for it
  to sit between. Bring back a generated one at the first public MVP release.
- **`PROMPT_TO_RESUME.md`**. An honestly maintained `docs/plan.md` *is* the
  resume prompt, and rewriting a separate untracked copy on every push was the
  most expensive rule in this guide.

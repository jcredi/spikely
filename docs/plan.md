# Current plan

**This file is the future tense only.** What is next, what is open, what we are
deliberately not doing. When something ships it *leaves* this file - the record
of what was done and why lives in [`worklog.md`](worklog.md), newest entry
first. Do not add a "done" section here; it only grows a third copy of history
that then drifts.

**Status (2026-09-12).** MVP snow layer is functionally complete and live on
`https://nevaio.netlify.app`: the real GFSC pipeline composes the frozen spec
section 9.2 AS-OF rule over a 30-day window across 58 MGRS tiles, publishes to
Cloudflare R2 on a daily 04:35 UTC schedule, and has run unattended since
2026-08-28. Place search (section 6.1) is done, on MapTiler Geocoding. A
security review and its remediation closed on 2026-09-09; posture is in
[`security.md`](security.md). The mobile-first UI was verified on a real
handset on 2026-09-11.

**Spec section 7 - the OSM object panel - completed 2026-09-12** and is live:
the object index is published to R2 (54 shards, 211,881 objects), selection
covers all 58 tiles, the daily pipeline samples per-object GFSC, and the panel
draws real snow history over a trailing 30-day window; item 1 is now watching
rather than building.

**A-to-B routing (item 2) is half done as of 2026-09-13.** The route itself
works - endpoints picked from the object panel, a real Mapbox Directions
walking route on the map, distance, and the section 8.6 disclaimer - and is
committed behind `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`, which is not set anywhere, so the feature
is invisible on production. **Next work is the two things that block the rest
of section 8: the owner's Mapbox token, and an elevation source.**

## Next, in order

1. **OSM object panel - spec section 7 is complete, and now needs watching
   rather than building.** Selection, the panel, the chart, the published
   index, the daily sampling and the historical backfill all shipped
   2026-09-12; the chart draws real per-object GFSC history on the deployed
   site. What is left is operational, not construction:
   - **Watch the next few daily runs.** The first run created every tile's
     permanent slot map; subsequent runs exercise the *extend* path, which has
     never run. The invariant to watch is that slot counts only ever grow and
     that `series/<TILE>/<YYYY-MM>.bin` length stays `slots x days x 2`.
   - **The backfill exists but is probably not needed.** The daily job samples
     its whole 31-day window every run, so the first run alone populated 13
     Aug - 11 Sept, and a trailing 30-day window is continuously covered
     without any backfill at all. `backfill-object-series.yml` is there for
     history *deeper* than 30 days, which since amendment v1.13 nothing
     requires. Run it only if that depth is wanted for its own sake; it merges
     rather than overwrites, so running it is safe but not free.
   - One open contract question from the first consumer: whether
     `bytes`/`sha256` stay in the shard index (the frontend does verify them).
   - Anything needing to know where Nevaio shows snow must ask
     `nevaio_pipeline.footprint`, not re-derive it.

2. **A-to-B routing + snow/elevation profile (spec section 8) - the route
   ships, the profile does not.** Shipped 2026-09-13 in
   `app/src/features/route/`: Mapbox Directions `mapbox/walking`, endpoints
   nominated from the object panel, route geometry and endpoints on the map,
   distance, and the section 8.6 disclaimer with every route. Sampling geometry
   (`routeProfile.ts`) is built and tested but nothing consumes it yet. What is
   left, in the order it unblocks:
   - **Create the URL-restricted Mapbox token** (owner console work - see
     "Open" below). Until it exists and is set as a Netlify env var, the whole
     feature is invisible on production by design. Nothing else here can be
     verified against a real route without it.
   - **An elevation source**, decided 2026-09-12 as a precomputed Copernicus
     GLO-30 extract in R2 (fallback: MapTiler Terrain-RGB). Mapbox Directions
     returns no elevation, so this is what section 8.3's elevation gain/loss
     and section 8.4's elevation profile both wait on. `du` the bucket before
     building it - see the R2 headroom item below, where the DEM is the one
     claimant worth sizing.
   - **Snow along the route**, and this needs a data source the frontend does
     not have. The published PNG tiles encode freshness as five discrete
     colours and coverage as alpha, so reading FSC back out of them loses the
     QA tier entirely - and spec section 15 item 11 makes freshness *and*
     quality a firm requirement on the profile, stronger than section 8.4-8.5
     currently read. The honest options are a separate lossless per-date data
     raster (GF/QA/age packed per pixel) published beside the visual tiles, or
     narrowing what the profile claims. Size the first before choosing.
   - **Spec section 15 items 1 and 2 are still open** and should be decided
     against real numbers rather than in advance: the sampling *mechanism* is
     now concrete (even spacing in ground metres, endpoints preserved exactly,
     bounded sample count, default 60 m = GFSC's native pixel), but the
     spacing value and the definition of "route snow-covered percentage" are
     not closed by that.
   - The linked map/profile interaction (section 8.5) has its map side ready -
     `RouteLayer.setCursor` - and no profile to drive it yet.

3. **Repository structure refactor, stage 4**
   ([`../REFACTOR.md`](../REFACTOR.md)). Stages 1 (dissolve `recon/`) and 2
   (package the pipeline) are done - 2026-09-09; stage 3 (regroup the frontend
   into `app/src/features/`) is done - 2026-09-12. Stage 4 (contracts) waits
   for the OSM object panel, which is the work that would actually consume a
   shared encoding - so it is gated on item 1, not on anything structural.
   When it starts, note that `REFACTOR.md`'s target tree was written
   2026-09-09 and has already drifted once: it names frontend files that no
   longer exist and renames that later work made wrong. Verify against the
   repository, as that document's own instructions say.

## Open

- **Spec section 15** is the canonical list of undecided product questions.
  Live ones: route sampling method and "snow-covered percentage" definition
  (1, 2), basemap/terrain provider (4), optional 20 m FSCOG layer (10).
  **Items 6 and 7 were decided 2026-09-12** from
  [`research/routing-and-dem-options.md`](research/routing-and-dem-options.md):
  routing is **Mapbox Directions** (`mapbox/walking`), elevation is a
  **precomputed Copernicus GLO-30 extract into the existing R2 bucket**.
  Routing was OpenRouteService for part of that day; it is not, because ORS
  forbids client-side keys and this app has no backend - see the correction in
  that document before reopening the question.
- **Create the URL-restricted Mapbox token** (owner console work; routing is
  now built and waiting on it, 2026-09-13). It must be a **new** token, not
  the account's default: Mapbox's URL restrictions do not apply to default
  tokens, so the default would ship unrestricted in a public bundle - the very
  problem that disqualified OpenRouteService. Restrict it to the Netlify
  origin, set it as a Netlify env var (`VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`) across all
  contexts, and deliberately do **not** mark it secret, for the same reason
  `VITE_MAPTILER_API_KEY` is not: Vite inlines `VITE_*` into the client bundle
  by design, so secret-scanning would fail the build on a value meant to reach
  the browser. `api.mapbox.com` is already in `connect-src` in
  `app/public/_headers` (added 2026-09-13 with the routing code), so the token
  is the only remaining step.
- **Custom domain in front of the `r2.dev` endpoint** (security F10, optional
  pre-launch). Owner console work; needs an Admin-scoped Cloudflare token.
  `app/public/_headers` pins the bucket host in its CSP and must change in the
  same commit - see [`r2-setup.md`](r2-setup.md) step 4.
- **Snow tile 404s make the browser console noisy.** The pipeline publishes
  only tiles that contain data, but MapLibre requests the full grid inside the
  manifest's `bounds`, so every empty cell 404s - five in one production
  viewport on 2026-09-09. Functionally harmless and long-standing; the cost is
  that a real error can hide in the noise. Options when it is worth doing:
  publish a 1x1 transparent PNG for empty cells (simple, more objects in R2),
  or narrow the published `bounds`/per-zoom coverage so the grid matches what
  actually exists (cheaper at runtime, more pipeline work). Not urgent.
- **R2 free-tier headroom.** **Measured 2026-09-12: 40.79 MB across 7.07k
  objects** - far under the 10 GB allowance, but that is a *September* figure
  and must not be read as the steady state: the archive is mostly snow-free
  tiles right now. The projection that matters is mid-winter, where a 31-date
  archive is roughly 4.0 GB and ~109,000 objects. Against that, the object
  index (28.6 MB), the per-object series (~26 MB at the two-month depth
  amendment v1.13 leaves) and a Copernicus GLO-30 extract are the other
  claimants. The first two are rounding errors; **the DEM extract is the one
  worth sizing before it is built**, and its size is still an estimate. They
  have to fit in the remaining
  ~6 GB, or the date window shortens - `config.ASOF_CATALOGUE_DATES` is the
  one dial. Re-measure in midwinter, when the number means something - the
  September reading above cannot tell us whether the DEM fits.
- **The recovery path is unrehearsed** - revoke the publication key, restore
  trusted code, rebuild dependencies, republish known-good data.

## Ideas parked - owner's, 2026-09-13, not scheduled

Neither is committed to; both are recorded so they are not re-invented from
scratch, and because the second one needs its risks written down *before*
anyone gets enthusiastic about it.

- **Flag suspicious values in the data rather than only rendering them.**
  Worth doing, and cheap. The per-object series already carries everything a
  detector needs - GF, QA tier, observation age - and
  `docs/research/gfsc-findings.md` (2026-09-13) has the first real measurements
  to calibrate against. Candidate signals, in rough order of
  value-per-effort: a large day-over-day swing where *both* endpoints are
  age 0 (the Monte Cevedale shape); a value far from its neighbours' on the
  same day at similar elevation, which is what separates a sampling fault from
  weather; a whole tile flipping together, which is the opposite signature and
  usually real; and a value physically implausible for its elevation and date.
  The honest output is a flag on the mark - "this looks odd" - never
  suppression: hiding a suspect reading is the same class of lie as inventing
  one. Note the trap found on 2026-09-13: 82% of marks are the product's own
  gap-fill, so any detector must compare like with like or it will flag every
  carried-forward run as an anomaly.

- **Nearest measured snow depth, with distance and elevation delta - a
  nice-to-have for a future version.** Owner's decision, 2026-09-13: this is
  the shape worth building if snow depth is ever added. Public alpine station
  networks publish real snow-depth readings - SLF/IMIS in Switzerland, the
  regional Lawinenwarndienste in Austria, AINEVA/Meteomont in Italy. Surface
  the nearest stations' *actual* measurements beside a selected object, stating
  plainly how far away each is and how much higher or lower, and let the
  mountaineer do the extrapolating. It invents nothing, and it fits the
  existing architecture: another periodic static fetch published to R2, no new
  running server, no backend. Unscheduled, and behind spec section 8 routing in
  any case.
  Worth checking before building: each network's licence and whether it permits
  redistribution (they differ, and some are more restrictive than Copernicus);
  update cadence; and whether station metadata carries a usable elevation, since
  the elevation delta is most of the value.

- **Rejected, and worth not re-litigating: modelling or estimating snow depth
  ourselves.** Considered 2026-09-13 and turned down on the merits, not for
  effort. GFSC measures fractional *area*, not depth, and there is no sound
  conversion - 100% cover is 5 cm or 5 m - so any figure would come from a
  model in which GFSC only constrains where snow is. Errors would be largest
  exactly where the decisions are made: wind-loaded lee slopes, gullies and
  cornices, where depth varies over metres in terrain no tractable resolution
  can see. And it is avalanche-adjacent: this app already refuses to show a
  months-old raster because it could be read as current (spec section 5.4),
  and a modelled depth carries the same hazard with a wider blast radius,
  because a number reads as more authoritative than an image. Authoritative
  regional avalanche bulletins exist; a hobby estimate sitting beside them is
  worse than no estimate. If it is ever attempted anyway, the honest form is a
  range wide enough to be uncomfortable, labelled an estimate, never a single
  number, and validated against held-out station data before it ships.

/**
 * Ask a search result the same matching question a tap already answers.
 *
 * A search hit is a MapTiler geocoding result, not an index record - it can
 * be missing from the index entirely, or resolve to a record whose name
 * disagrees with the geocoder's. We never trust the geocoder's own identity
 * for the panel/history; `resolveSelection` runs again exactly as it would
 * for a tap at the same point, so "found nothing", "ambiguous", "too coarse a
 * scale" and "found it, but look what's actually there" all go through the
 * one honest pipeline `presentSelection` already implements. The search
 * marker (dropped by the search bar at the geocoder's own coordinate) and the
 * selection highlight (dropped at the index record's coordinate, if any) can
 * end up in visibly different places - that gap *is* the answer to "do these
 * two sources agree", not a bug to hide.
 *
 * The scale floor (`SELECTION_MAX_METERS_PER_PIXEL`) applies unchanged: a
 * search result is just another point on the map, and the floor exists
 * because coarse-scale proximity matching is unreliable regardless of how the
 * point arrived. A search that lands zoomed out (e.g. a whole valley or
 * region) will show the same "zoom in to select" notice a tap would - that is
 * the deliberate, consistent answer rather than a second invented rule for
 * "search near enough an object to guess".
 *
 * Shards load lazily by viewport (`objectIndex.ts`), so the destination's
 * shard may not be loaded yet even after the camera arrives. Rather than race
 * that load against `resolveSelection`, this waits for the fly to finish
 * (`moveend`, the same signal `refreshShards` already uses elsewhere) and
 * then awaits `ensureLoaded` itself before resolving - so a fresh search
 * result is judged against the shard it actually lands in, never a stale or
 * still-loading one. A `token` guards against a second search superseding
 * this one mid-flight: only the most recent search may reach the panel.

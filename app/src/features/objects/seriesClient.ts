/**
 * The loading boundary for one object's snow-history series (spec section
 * 7.1). Everything provider-specific - the slot map, the `.bin` Range reads,
 * how a missing month is told apart from a broken request - lives here.
 *
 * Layout, mirroring `pipeline/src/nevaio_pipeline/object_series.py` and
 * `object_slots.py` exactly (see `seriesFormat.ts` and `slotMapSchema.ts` for
 * the decoded shapes):
 *
 *   `<seriesBaseUrl>/object-index/slots/<TILE>.json` - permanent id -> row slot
 *   `<seriesBaseUrl>/series/<TILE>/<YYYY-MM>.bin`    - one calendar month, object-major
 *
 * The two prefixes differ because the artifacts have different lifecycles and
 * different owners in the bucket: slot maps are permanent state published
 * beside the object index they are keyed to (`publish_object_series.py` writes
 * them under `object-index/`), while month files are ordinary run output at
 * the bucket root. `seriesBaseUrl` is therefore the bucket root, and is still
 * the single trust anchor - both paths are resolved against it and must stay
 * on its origin and directory.
 *
 * The whole point of the object-major layout (`docs/plan.md` item 1,
 * `object_series.object_month_range`) is that one object's whole month is a
 * single contiguous byte range - a 62-byte read for a 31-day month - so the
 * frontend never downloads another object's history to read one object's own.
 * This client issues an HTTP `Range` request for exactly that range
 * (`worklog.md` 2026-09-12 measured that R2 answers a 62-byte ranged GET with
 * `206` and the right bytes, with CORS intact).
 *
 * **The one contract rule that is not an ordinary HTTP error**: a Range read
 * past the end of an *older* month file means the object had no slot that
 * month (it was not in the OSM extract yet) - genuine absence, not failure.
 * `object_month_range`'s docstring is the authority on why this is safe:
 * offsets depend only on the object's own permanent slot, and slots are
 * append-only, so a slot allocated later is necessarily past an older month's
 * length. This client therefore treats an HTTP 416, a 404 on the month file
 * itself, and a response shorter than the requested range the same way: that
 * whole month is a gap, decoded as `no_data` for every day in it, never as a
 * load failure.
 *
 * **Only a `206` is trusted as the requested bytes.** An earlier version of
 * this client fell back to slicing a `200` response client-side, reasoning
 * that a server might ignore `Range` and return the whole file - but a `200`
 * to a Range request is exactly what a dev server's SPA fallback returns for
 * a *missing* path too (measured locally: an existing `.bin` answers `206`;
 * a nonexistent one answers `200 text/html`, and slicing that would have
 * decoded arbitrary HTML bytes as a snow reading). R2 already answers a real
 * Range request with `206` (`docs/worklog.md`, 2026-09-12), so nothing this
 * app actually talks to needs the fallback, and the failure mode of removing
 * it - occasionally missing bytes a Range-ignoring server could have served -
 * is far cheaper than the failure mode of keeping it.
 *
 * This module is not one of the pure, Node-tested layers (`seriesFormat.ts`,
 * `seriesPresets.ts`, `seriesChartLayout.ts`): it does real `fetch` calls, the
 * same posture `objectIndex.ts` takes for the shard loader it mirrors. It is
 * exercised by `npm run build` (type-checked) and manual verification against
 * a real publication, not by `npm test` - there is no published series to
 * fetch yet (see `docs/plan.md` item 1).

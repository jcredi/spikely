/**
 * The route planner's state machine (spec section 8), kept out of `main.ts`.
 *
 * There are four states and the whole feature is the transitions between them:
 *
 *   empty      - nothing picked; the object panel shows two route buttons
 *   half       - one endpoint picked; `RoutePrompt` says which is still needed
 *   calculating- both picked; one request in flight
 *   settled    - a route, a "no route" answer, or an error, in `RoutePanel`
 *
 * Two rules hold it together and both exist to keep the bottom of a phone
 * screen sane, where every one of this app's layout bugs has been:
 *
 *  1. **Only one bottom sheet is open at a time.** The object panel is the
 *     picking surface; the route panel is the result. Opening one closes the
 *     other. `map/bottomSheet.ts` would cope with both being open, but the
 *     user would not.
 *  2. **The route survives what does not concern it.** Changing the AS-OF date
 *     or closing the object panel leaves the route alone; only an explicit
 *     clear removes it. A route is work the user did.
 *
 * Endpoints are `ObjectRecord`s from Nevaio's own index, never a geocoder's
 * coordinates - the same identity contract the object panel enforces (spec
 * amendment v1.11). A searched place reaches here only after
 * `resolveSelection` has matched it to a real index record, so the name shown
 * beside the route is the name of the thing the app actually routed to.

/**
 * The route bottom sheet (spec section 8.3): what the app knows about the
 * route it just calculated, and what it does not know yet.
 *
 * It is the second of Nevaio's two bottom sheets, so it registers with
 * `map/bottomSheet.ts` exactly as the object panel does and the snow control
 * lifts clear of whichever is open.
 *
 * Plain DOM and `textContent` only, never `innerHTML` (spec section 15 item
 * 8), the same rule the object panel follows: an endpoint's name comes from
 * the OSM object index and must never be able to become markup.
 *
 * **Two deliberate omissions, both about not overstating what we have:**
 *
 *  - **No walking time.** Mapbox Directions returns a `duration`, and it is
 *    not shown. It is an urban-walking estimate computed on flat-ground pace
 *    with no elevation input at all, and this app's whole subject is alpine
 *    terrain where ascent, not distance, sets the time. A number that says
 *    "2 h 10" for a route with 1,400 m of climbing is not a rough estimate,
 *    it is wrong in the direction that gets people caught out after dark -
 *    precisely the kind of harm spec section 8.6's disclaimer exists for.
 *    When a DEM lands (`docs/plan.md` item 2), an ascent-aware estimate could
 *    be offered honestly; until then there is nothing to show.
 *  - **No elevation gain/loss.** Spec section 8.3 asks for it "where
 *    available or derivable", and from Mapbox Directions alone it is neither:
 *    the provider returns no elevation for the walking profile. The panel
 *    says so rather than leaving a silent gap a reader would fill in with an
 *    assumption.
 *
 * The disclaimer (spec section 8.6) is not a footnote here: it is rendered
 * with every calculated route, and it is not dismissible.
